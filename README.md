## Project 1: Data Modeling with Postgres
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app.
They'd like a data engineer to create a Postgres database for song play analysis. 

The objective is to create Data Model in Postgres and build an ETL pipeline using Python.
